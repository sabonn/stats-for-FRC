# Stats For FRC
this repo is a baseline on how to use the TBA api v3 for an application.
in this repo you will find 2 python files:
  1. main.py - how to use the functions that were written.
  2. lib.py - contains an example on how to use the TBA api

due to the TBA api being a REST api you don't need to use python for it, you just need a request library.

in the future I'll update this repo with the full application which uses the examples that we're made.
